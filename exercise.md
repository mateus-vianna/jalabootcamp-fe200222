# Thunks

## To deliver this exercise you should  fork from this repo and commit back on a branch your_name_27


## On this exercise you guys should finish user CRUD thunk actions. Right now we only have a read thunk "loadUsersThunk". You should also improve the listUsers page making possible to delete and edit an user. Feel free to create a details page if you want to! The main goal is to have the possibility to make changes on an user.

### Make sure that users actions are still appearing on redux timeline.
### You should present loading when a thunk action is happening and an error if the action doesn't go well. Since I wasn't able to fix it. That's on you guys
